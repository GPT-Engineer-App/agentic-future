# agentic-future

Create a cutting-edge web application using crewai and Streamlit that showcases advanced software building agents. The application should be developed across 4-7 Python files and include the following key features:

Web Interface:

Use Streamlit to create an intuitive and responsive user interface.
Implement a sidebar for customizable AI agent settings (e.g., AI provider selection, temperature, max tokens).


Agent-based Workflow:

Utilize crewai to create a team of AI agents (e.g., Software Architect, Full-Stack Developer, Quality Assurance Engineer).
Define specific roles, goals, and backstories for each agent.
Implement tasks for software design, implementation, and testing.


Sandboxed Environment:

Develop a secure sandbox class to isolate and manage the execution environment.
Ensure all operations (browsing, terminal access, file management) are performed within this sandbox.


Internet Browsing:

Create a secure browsing module that allows agents to access web resources safely.
Implement a simple interface for URL input and display of browsing results.


Terminal Access:

Develop a secure terminal emulation module for command-line operations.
Include basic command execution functionality with appropriate security measures.


File Management:

Implement a file management system for code and asset handling.
Include features for file upload, content display, and saving within the sandboxed environment.


Custom Agentic Framework:

Design a state-of-the-art agentic framework with customizable settings.
Allow users to adjust AI provider settings, temperature, and other relevant parameters.


Advanced Memory System:

Implement an AdvancedMemory class to store and retrieve information for agents.
Provide a simple interface to display the current state of the memory system.


Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) System:

Develop a basic RAGSystem class for knowledge retrieval and generation.
Include placeholder methods for querying and updating the knowledge base.


Integration and Workflow:

Ensure seamless integration between all components (crewai, Streamlit, custom modules).
Implement a clear workflow that demonstrates the software development process using AI agents.


Error Handling and Security:

Implement proper error handling throughout the application.
Ensure all user inputs are validated and sanitized to prevent security vulnerabilities.


Documentation and Comments:

Provide clear, concise comments throughout the code to explain the functionality and design decisions.
Include docstrings for classes and methods to facilitate future development and maintenance.


Logging and Debugging:

Implement a logging system to capture the "inner monologue" of the AI agents during the development process.
Create a debug output or "scratchpad" feature to display the step-by-step thought processes of the agents.



When developing this application, focus on creating a unique, futuristic development environment that pushes the boundaries of AI-assisted software development. The final product should be a one-of-a-kind build that showcases the potential future of software, web, and mobile app development.
Take your time to carefully design and implement each component, ensuring that the result is a cohesive, innovative, and functional system that will impress and inspire those in the AI space.
